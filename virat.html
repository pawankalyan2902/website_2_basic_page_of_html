            <p id="para">Virat Kohli born 5 November 1988 is an Indian
                international
                cricketer and the former captain of the Indian national cricket team who plays as a right-handed batsman for
                Royal
                Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and for Delhi in Indian domestic cricket. Widely regarded as one of the
                greatest
                batsmen of all time,[4] Kohli holds the records for scoring most runs in T20 internationals and in the IPL.
                In 2020,
                the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade. Kohli has also contributed to
                a number
                of India's successes, including winning the 2011 World Cup and the 2013 Champions trophy.</p>

                <li>The kind of form he's in, he picked this ball yesterday afternoon.</li>

                <li>There's no shame in being beaten by a genius. Virat Kohli is a freak.</li>
                <li>The sandstorm from Sachin at Sharjah and the hailstorm from Kohli in Mohali should be written in the
                    same paragraph</li>
                <li>To become a good player, you need talent. To become a great player, you need an attitude like Kohli's.

                <li>Virat Kohli's success does not surprise you. His failures do</li>
                <li>This guy is abusing the form he's in. The kookaburra can't take any more punishment</li>
